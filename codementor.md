## 1. Introduction to React native
React Native is a framework for building mobile apps using React and JavaScript. It has support for building mobile apps for the iOS and Android platforms. The framework is open-sourced by Facebook on March 2015. It is built on the premise: **Learn once, Write anywhere**.

Learning React is a one-time effort. Using React for UI, we can build web applications and mobile apps.  React Native facilitates building mobile apps using React. React Native has a set of React components for iOS and Android platforms.

The React components available with React Native gets translated to native components. This provides better-feeling experiences that are consistent with the mobile platform.

The [Facebook post](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1014532261909640/react-native-bringing-modern-web-techniques-to-mobile/) explains why "native is necessary".

## 2. Tutorial
The tutorial extends a Todo iOS app built with React Native to the Android platform. The Todo app is super-simple. It has two tabs. The first tab has the Todo list.

When the Todo item is done, press the Done button. This will remove the Todo item from the list. The second tab has the `Add Todo` form.

In this tutorial, we will retrofit the app for the Android platform.

### A. Getting started with Android in React Native.

(setting up, exploring android folder)

### B.  Using equivalent Android components

(Moving TabBarIOS to ToolbarAndroid, DrawerLayoutAndroid)
handling progress

### C. Android only components

(ViewPager, Toast, TimePicker)

### D. Other differences

(keyboard handling, additional props, etc)

### E. Wrapping up
(Underlying idea - having a native feel)
Github project.
