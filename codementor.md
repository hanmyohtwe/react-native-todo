## Introduction to React native
React Native is a framework for building mobile apps using React and JavaScript. It has support for building mobile apps for the iOS and Android platforms. The framework is open-sourced by Facebook on March 2015. It is built on the premise: **Learn once, Write anywhere**.

Learning React is a one-time effort. Using React for UI, we can build web applications and mobile apps.  React Native facilitates building mobile apps using React. React Native has a set of React components for iOS and Android platforms.

The React components available with React Native gets translated to native components. This provides better-feeling experiences that are consistent with the mobile platform.
